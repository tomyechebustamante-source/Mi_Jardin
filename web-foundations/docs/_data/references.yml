        readableText: "A List Apart\n\nFor people who make websites\n\nIn a world where AI can generate good-looking work instantly, “good” can’t carry the weight it used to carry in design conversations. What can carry that weight are language and actions that reflect what design has always been at its best: goals-aligned, research-informed, constraints-aware, and outcomes-focused. Returning ALA author Justin Dauer explains.\n\nWhile Hitler plotted and Europe crumbled, a motley crew of mathematicians, philosophers, architects, and economists met weekly to invent Computer Science. Mark Bernstein mines this forgotten history for lessons that just might save today’s web from its worst impulses.\n\nBuild advanced skills for growing career opportunities. Choose from tracks in content strategy, UX/UI, communication with data, and learning design."

Support it!\n\nAnimista is a place where you can play with a collection of pre-made CSS animations, tweak them and get only those you will actually use.\n\nAnimista started out as a small side-project of mine . As I was increasingly using CSS animations, I thought it would come in handy to have them organised in a meaningful and accessible way so that they can be easily reused on different projects.\n\nThe idea was to create a playground of a sorts where a collection of pre-made animations could be tested and tweaked before actually using them. Seeing how various options like easing, delay, duration and others affect the animation proved to be very useful. And basically that is how Animista was born.\n\nI have been using Animista for a while now and I hope some of you will find it useful as well. It is still very much a work in progress and hopefully it will evolve over the time :)"

I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering, where great user experience meets robust, clean, and scalable code.\n\nCurrently, I&#x27;m a senior frontend engineer at Klaviyo , where I work on the component library team to help maintain and evolve our design system. In this role, I lead accessibility efforts across components, tooling, and patterns, partnering closely with designers and engineers to ensure accessibility is part of our core architecture.\n\nPreviously, I’ve worked across a wide range of environments, from product studios to startups and large tech companies, including Apple , Starry Internet , and Upstatement . Alongside my professional work, I also created an online video course a few years ago which walks through building a real-world, API-driven application from scratch. These experiences have shaped how I think about building products that are both well-crafted and widely usable.\n\nOutside of work, you can usually find me climbing, playing tennis, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds K o r o k s e e d s ."

Upon further research, it seems like we no longer need to trap focus within the &lt;dialog&gt; (even in modal mode)."

        readableText: "by Jeremy Thomas\n\nLet's say you have a product, a portfolio, or just an idea you want to share with everyone on your own website. Before you publish it on the internet, you want to make it look attractive, professional, or at least decent to look at.\n\nWhat is the first thing you need to work on?\n\nThe purpose of design is to enhance the presentation of the content it's applied to. It might sound obvious, but content being the primary element of a website, it should not be established as an afterthought.\n\nWritten content, like the paragraph you're currently reading, makes up for more than 90% of the Web. Styling this textual content will go a long way."

Learn why traditional fallback values can fail, and how `@property` features improve the resilience of custom property definitions.\n\nSometimes, improving your application CSS just takes a one-line upgrade or enhancement! Learn about 12 properties to start incorporating into your projects, and enjoy reducing technical debt, removing JavaScript, and scoring easy wins for user experience.\n\nReview behaviors to be aware of regarding how the browser computes final custom property values. A misunderstanding of this process may lead to an unexpected or missing value and difficulty troubleshooting and resolving the issue.\n\nExplore modern project architecture, theming, responsive layouts, and component design. Learn to improve code organization, dig into layout techniques, and review real-world, context-aware components that use cutting-edge CSS techniques."

        readableText: "Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. As of 2024, over 45 million web domains markup their web pages with over 450 billion Schema.org objects. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.\n\nFounded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub .\n\nA shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas.\n\nWe invite you to get started !\n\nView our blog at blog.schema.org or see release history for version 29.4."

        readableTitle: "Scroll-driven Animations A bunch of demos and tools to show off Scroll-driven Animations"
        readableText: "Scroll-driven animations are a common UX pattern on the web. These are animations that are linked to the scroll position of a scroll container . This means that as you scroll up or down, the linked animation scrubs forward or backward in direct response. Think of interesting effects such as parallax background images or reading indicators which move as you scroll. A similar type of scroll-driven animation is an animation that is linked to an element's position within its scroll container . With it, for example, elements can fade-in as they come into view.\n\nThe classic way to achieve these kinds of effects is to respond to scroll events on the main thread . This makes creating performant scroll-driven animations that are in-sync with scrolling impossible or very difficult. Thanks to the Scroll-driven Animations specification , you now have access to new APIs and concepts that enable declarative scroll-driven animations that work in conjunction with the existing Web Animations API (WAAPI) and CSS Animations API .\n\nBy having scroll-driven animations integrate with these two existing APIs, scroll-driven animations can benefit from all advantages these APIs bring. That includes the ability to have these animations run off the main thread. Yes, read that correctly: you can now have silky smooth animations, driven by scroll, running off the main thread … and all that with just a few lines of extra code – What's not to like?!\n\n⚠️ Your browser does not support Scroll-Linked Animations. To cater for this, a polyfill has been loaded.\n\nUse the ℹ️ icon on each demo page to know more about how that specific demo was created. Several demos come in multiple versions. To switch versions, hit the 🔀 icon."

            - Testimonials
            - "Speed up your \nwebsite with Tinify"
            - "Optimizing your images with the TinyPNG algorithm brings several benefits to your website. TinyPNG reduces file sizes by up to 80% without sacrificing quality, leading to faster page loads. This optimization is essential for keeping user attention and ensuring an enjoyable user experience. Additionally, it minimizes bandwidth usage, making your website more efficient and cost-effective. Image compression also plays a role in SEO, as efficiently compressed images contribute to faster page speeds and improve your website's search engine ranking."
            - "Yes, TinyPNG supports WebP images. Our compression feature enables users to achieve the most optimal results when working with WebP files.WebP, a web image file format created by Google, is supported by major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera. This format excels in achieving reduced file sizes while maintaining optimal image quality. Consequently, WebP images are smaller in size compared to PNG and JPEG counterparts, contributing to faster website loading times. This is particularly beneficial for your users, ensuring swift page load times and minimizing bandwidth costs, especially for mobile users.It’s worth highlighting that despite WebP’s inherent size advantages, Tinify’s optimization can further decrease the file size. The intelligent algorithm ensures that there are no visible differences while more savings are made."
            - "TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your WEBP, AVIF, JPEG and PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!"
            - "Currently, Tinify supports AVIF, WebP, JPG, PNG and APNG (animated PNG). We are continuously working to expand our portfolio to include additional formats in the future."
            - "HEIC is an image format that compresses photos very efficiently, but it is not widely supported by many other devices and platforms. To ensure your images work everywhere, TinyPNG automatically converts HEIC files to JPG, a widely accepted format.If you prefer a next-gen format like AVIF, you can easily convert it with the online optimizer. Avif images offer better quality and smaller file sizes than other formats. The best format you choose depends on how you plan to use the images."
            - "At Tinify, your privacy is our top priority. Rest assured, only you have access to the images you upload. We retain them for a maximum of 48 hours, after which they are permanently deleted.For additional details on privacy, please refer to our Terms of Use, specifically sections 8 and 9. These sections provide comprehensive information on privacy policies and data processing operations."
            - "Panda says: Excellent question! We frequently use PNG images but were frustrated with the load times. We created TinyPNG in our quest to make our websites faster and more fun to use with the best compression.In 2014 we added intelligent compression for JPEG images and in 2016 we added support for animated PNG. Compressing images with the website is free for everyone and we like to keep it that way! If you like TinyPNG please contribute by making a donation"
            - "Lossy compression is a method that reduces file sizes by removing certain data from the original file, often resulting in a loss of quality. However, with TinyPNG’s intelligent algorithm, we can achieve large savings without visible quality loss. Tinify uses smart lossy compression techniques to decrease the size of your pictures and make them ready for web use."
            - "Our compression engine employs a smart algorithm to determine the best optimization levels tailored to each image's unique content, considering factors like colors, textures, and patterns. Unlike one-size-fits-all approaches, we understand that each image requires specific compression settings for optimal results.Take, for example, the selective decrease in the number of colors within an image. This strategic approach not only maintains image quality but also significantly reduces the number of bytes needed to store the data. Thanks to our intelligent algorithm, the optimization process results in nearly invisible effects on the image while making a big difference in file size."
            - "Panda says: Excellent question! When you upload a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file, similar colors in your image are combined. This technique is called “quantization”. By reducing the number of colors, 24-bit PNG files can be converted to much smaller 8-bit indexed color images. All unnecessary metadata is stripped too. The result better PNG files with 100% support for transparency. Have your cake and eat it too!Unnecessary metadata is stripped as well. You will get an optimal image, every time!"
            - "PNG is useful because it’s the only widely supported format that can store partially transparent images. The format uses compression, but the files can still be large. Use TinyPNG to shrink images for your apps and sites. It will use less bandwidth and load faster."
            - "Panda says: Excellent question! When you upload a JPEG file, the image is analyzed. Textures, patterns and colors are automatically identified. The encoder creates an optimally compressed JPEG file based on that information. The final result is compared with the original and fine-tuned. Distracting JPEG artifacts are minimized without big sacrifices in file size. Unnecessary metadata is stripped as well. You will get an optimal image, every time!"
            - "TinyPNG removes all unnecessary metadata from the images to reduce file size.Please note that this process might result in the optimized image appearing with a different dpi (dots per inch) or color profile, as default values will be applied in the absence of metadata.If there's a need to preserve specific metadata from your images, consider exploring our Developer API. The API offers an option to retain certain metadata such as copyright, location, and creation date. Further details about this feature can be found in the API documentation."
            - "Panda says: Excellent question! The files produced by TinyPNG are displayed perfectly on all modern browsers including mobile devices. Still need to support Internet Explorer 6? It normally ignores PNG transparency and displays a solid background color. With TinyPNG the background becomes transparent again. Binary transparency without any workarounds!"
            - "Panda says: Excellent question! Chrome, Firefox, Safari and now Microsoft Edge all support APNG. Only Internet Explorer does not support the format yet.Apple added animated stickers to iMessage with the release of iOS 10. If you want to create and compress stickers under 500 KB take a look at the iMessage Panda sticker example on GitHub."
            - "Certainly! Feel free to use the drag-and-drop web optimizer at tinypng.com. Free users have the flexibility to upload up to 20 images at once, each with a maximum size of 5MB.For those looking to convert images to other file types, you can freely convert up to 3 images.If you find that you need more capacity, feel free to explore our Web Pro and Web Ultra subscriptions. These subscriptions provide additional benefits for optimizing your images beyond the limits of our free offering."
            - "The TinyPNG compressor is a user-friendly tool designed for effortlessly minimizing the file size of your AVIF, WebP, PNG, and JPG images. Simply drag and drop your pictures onto the web interface, and let our intelligent algorithm compress them for optimal results."
            - "WebP has become a popular choice on the web, offering impressive performance in terms of both quality and size. Utilizing Tinify's image converter, you can effortlessly transform your JPG and PNG images into the WebP format.However, it's crucial not to dismiss other formats entirely, as they may still outperform WebP in certain scenarios. The Tinify online tool simplifies the process of finding the ideal image version for optimal performance. When converting to multiple formats, the smallest format is marked with a green check mark for your convenience."
            - "With Tinify's online optimizer, image conversion and compression are seamlessly combined into one powerful tool. Simply drag and drop your images onto the web interface, and watch as they are effortlessly converted to AVIF, WebP, PNG, or JPEG. Our integrated features ensure a smooth workflow, delivering optimized images that are ready for your website."
            - "For the online compressor, we offer two types of subscription plans to cater to different preferences and needs.The Web Pro subscription is designed for users seeking an essential tool for image compression, whether it's occasional optimization or bulk processing.On the other hand, Web Ultra is ideal for users desiring unlimited access to the web tool, allowing not only image compression but also the flexibility to convert images to different formats.

            - "Panda says: Excellent question! We frequently use PNG images but were frustrated with the load times. We created TinyPNG in our quest to make our websites faster and more fun to use with the best compression. In 2014 we added intelligent compression for JPEG images and in 2016 we added support for animated PNG. Compressing images with the website is free for everyone and we like to keep it that way! If you like TinyPNG please contribute by making a donation"
            - "Lossy compression is a method that reduces file sizes by removing certain data from the original file, often resulting in a loss of quality. However, with TinyPNG’s intelligent algorithm , we can achieve large savings without visible quality loss. Tinify uses smart lossy compression techniques to decrease the size of your pictures and make them ready for web use ."
            - "Our compression engine employs a smart algorithm to determine the best optimization levels tailored to each image&#x27;s unique content, considering factors like colors, textures, and patterns. Unlike one-size-fits-all approaches, we understand that each image requires specific compression settings for optimal results . Take, for example, the selective decrease in the number of colors within an image. This strategic approach not only maintains image quality but also significantly reduces the number of bytes needed to store the data. Thanks to our intelligent algorithm, the optimization process results in nearly invisible effects on the image while making a big difference in file size ."
            - "Panda says: Excellent question! When you upload a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file, similar colors in your image are combined. This technique is called “quantization”. By reducing the number of colors, 24-bit PNG files can be converted to much smaller 8-bit indexed color images. All unnecessary metadata is stripped too. The result better PNG files with 100% support for transparency. Have your cake and eat it too! Unnecessary metadata is stripped as well. You will get an optimal image, every time!"
            - "PNG is useful because it’s the only widely supported format that can store partially transparent images. The format uses compression, but the files can still be large. Use TinyPNG to shrink images for your apps and sites. It will use less bandwidth and load faster."
            - "Panda says: Excellent question! When you upload a JPEG file, the image is analyzed. Textures, patterns and colors are automatically identified. The encoder creates an optimally compressed JPEG file based on that information. The final result is compared with the original and fine-tuned. Distracting JPEG artifacts are minimized without big sacrifices in file size. Unnecessary metadata is stripped as well. You will get an optimal image, every time!"
            - "TinyPNG removes all unnecessary metadata from the images to reduce file size. Please note that this process might result in the optimized image appearing with a different dpi (dots per inch) or color profile, as default values will be applied in the absence of metadata. If there&#x27;s a need to preserve specific metadata from your images, consider exploring our Developer API. The API offers an option to retain certain metadata such as copyright, location, and creation date. Further details about this feature can be found in the API documentation ."
            - "Panda says: Excellent question! The files produced by TinyPNG are displayed perfectly on all modern browsers including mobile devices. Still need to support Internet Explorer 6? It normally ignores PNG transparency and displays a solid background color. With TinyPNG the background becomes transparent again. Binary transparency without any workarounds!"
            - "Panda says: Excellent question! Chrome, Firefox, Safari and now Microsoft Edge all support APNG. Only Internet Explorer does not support the format yet. Apple added animated stickers to iMessage with the release of iOS 10. If you want to create and compress stickers under 500 KB take a look at the iMessage Panda sticker example on GitHub."
            - "Certainly! Feel free to use the drag-and-drop web optimizer at tinypng.com. Free users have the flexibility to upload up to 20 images at once, each with a maximum size of 5MB. For those looking to convert images to other file types, you can freely convert up to 3 images. If you find that you need more capacity, feel free to explore our Web Pro and Web Ultra subscriptions. These subscriptions provide additional benefits for optimizing your images beyond the limits of our free offering."
            - "The TinyPNG compressor is a user-friendly tool designed for effortlessly minimizing the file size of your AVIF, WebP, PNG, and JPG images. Simply drag and drop your pictures onto the web interface, and let our intelligent algorithm compress them for optimal results."
            - "WebP has become a popular choice on the web, offering impressive performance in terms of both quality and size. Utilizing Tinify&#x27;s image converter , you can effortlessly transform your JPG and PNG images into the WebP format . However, it&#x27;s crucial not to dismiss other formats entirely, as they may still outperform WebP in certain scenarios. The Tinify online tool simplifies the process of finding the ideal image version for optimal performance. When converting to multiple formats, the smallest format is marked with a green check mark for your convenience."
            - "With Tinify&#x27;s online optimizer, image conversion and compression are seamlessly combined into one powerful tool. Simply drag and drop your images onto the web interface, and watch as they are effortlessly converted to AVIF, WebP, PNG, or JPEG. Our integrated features ensure a smooth workflow, delivering optimized images that are ready for your website."
            - "For the online compressor, we offer two types of subscription plans to cater to different preferences and needs. The Web Pro subscription is designed for users seeking an essential tool for image compression, whether it&#x27;s occasional optimization or bulk processing. On the other hand, Web Ultra is ideal for users desiring unlimited access to the web tool, allowing not only image compression but also the flexibility to convert images to different formats. Well-suited for those who require a comprehensive solution."
            - "We accept payments through Credit Card , PayPal , iDEAL , and AliPay . Please note that automatic renewals are currently exclusive to credit card payments."
            - "Certainly! We understand that your needs may evolve, and we want to accommodate that. To explore the details of each plan or to make changes to your subscription, log in to your account and visit the account dashboard."
            - "To cancel your subscription, simply disable the auto-renewal feature on your account dashboard. Your subscription will then automatically expire on the expiration date. Rest assured, we&#x27;ve got you covered with a reminder — one month before the expiration/renewal date, you&#x27;ll receive an email notifying you of the upcoming changes."
            - "It&#x27;s possible to purchase multiple licenses with one Tinify account. Please note that one license provides a full year of access to the extra features for a single user. Unfortunately, we do not support associating one Tinify account with multiple email addresses. In this case, we suggest using a shared email address for signup."
            - "To access the features of your paid subscription, make sure you are logged in on the website. Once logged in, your username, accompanied by a small crown icon, should be visible in the top right corner. If you don&#x27;t see your name there, you need to log in. For further information on login procedures, you can refer to our guide on Account login ."

        readableText: "Tobias Ahlin Bjerrome I design, tinker, &amp; teach. Blog. Responsive type scales with composable CSS utilities Read more With the help of calc(), clamp() and CSS vars, we can create composable, responsive, and fluid type scales that smoothly adapts to viewport and container widths.\n\nYou might be used to toggling classes on elements to handle state styles. What if we could just write CSS that reflected the state of the DOM?\n\nSelecting a previous sibling was for long impossible, but is now a breeze with the has() pseudo-class\n\nLearn how to use A/B-testing as a guiding compass for making product decisions, and how to avoid its pitfalls\n\nIf you miss method chaining from Ruby or jQuery when working with styles in JavaScript, you can recreate the pattern with a few lines of code"

        readableText: "All Posts Creative Hub Webzibition On-Scroll Typography Animations Inspiration and ideas for on-scroll typography animations that add an extra layer of creativity to a website design.\n\nFree course recommendation: Master JavaScript animation with GSAP through 34 free video lessons, step-by-step projects, and hands-on demos. Enroll now →\n\nMovement and transformation of type elements can elevate the user experience and add an extra layer of creativity to your design. So today we&#8217;d love to share some typography animations with you that get triggered by scrolling the page.\n\nWhen it comes to designing typographic animations, one of the key factors to consider is the transform origin. By adjusting the transform origin, you can change the direction and movement of the animation, totally changing the look and feel of it. Additionally, adjusting the rotation and scale values of the element can also greatly affect the animation&#8217;s visual appearance and overall impact. These values can be used to create a sense of depth, movement, and emphasis on the typography.\n\nBy playing with different combinations of all these values, you can create a wide range of animations, each one with a unique effect and suitable for different contexts like an editorial piece or semantically different sections of a website."

        readableText: "All Posts Creative Hub Webzibition Bringing Letters to Life: Coding a Kinetic SVG Typography Animation In this tutorial, you&#8217;ll learn how to recreate a captivating motion type effect using SVG and GreenSock.\n\nFree course recommendation: Master JavaScript animation with GSAP through 34 free video lessons, step-by-step projects, and hands-on demos. Enroll now →\n\nI recently discovered the website of&nbsp; Orion Icon library &nbsp;and I instantly fell in love with their motion opening video.\n\nThis video felt to me like a perfect challenge to recreate it using only SVG and&nbsp; GreenSock . I did adapt a bit the motion and used my own name instead of Orion, but here is my pretty decent result ✨\n\nSee the Pen Orion Icon Library intro animation by Louis Hoebregts ( @Mamboleoo ) on CodePen ."
