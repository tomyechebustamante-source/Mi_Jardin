# Tailwind CSS Learning Path — Complete Roadmap

> “To design is to think critically through making — each line of code is both form and reflection.”

> **AI Assistance Disclosure:** This learning path draws from classroom experience since September 2024, with AI iterations following research–practice–research cycles.

## 🎭 Atelier Methodology Overview

This learning path follows the **atelier methodology**:

- **Exploration** → Hands-on coding experiments
- **Reflection** → Understanding what happens behind the code
- **Conceptualization** → Connecting practical work to design theory
- **Production** → Building individual projects with critical awareness
- **Exhibition** → Publishing and discussing outcomes

## 🚀 Complete Tailwind CSS Journey

This comprehensive learning path takes you from zero to production-ready PWA using Tailwind CSS with Vite. Each session builds upon the previous, creating a complete portfolio application.
